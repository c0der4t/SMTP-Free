#### Summary
SMTP Free is a small lightweight utility that allows the sending of customized HTML / Plain text emails from scripts or other software using simple CLI commands or even by dropping an .html or .txt file in its queue

#### Build layout
The application has three components that work together to provide an easy-going user experience:

- Setup application: Allows for the setup of the SMTP account used to send emails as well as additional settings
- CLI: The CLI allows other software or scripts to call it with sufficient parameters which will be used to create a .html or .txt file, populated with custom variables etc. It will then drop the files in the service queue
- Service / Worker application: This is a service that runs in the background. As the queue fills it empties it by taking each file in the queue and sending it with the SMTP settings supplied.
